**Thoughts about the code**

- What makes it an amazing, okay, or a terrible code?
    - Honestly speaking, the code is somewhere between "okay" and "terrible". Although I commend the `BookingController.php` file for being slim, does what it's supposed to do, and very easy to read thanks to the presence of repository pattern. A lot of parts of the code can be refactored and/or broken down especially in the `BookingRepository.php` file if the developer utilized the amazing features Laravel already has.
- How would I have done it?
    - First of all, since I don't have the full context of the codebase like access to the `User` and `Job` models, how each functions in the `BookingController.php` are used in routes. I will not refactor the code to be working as it should be but rather I would point out which parts can be simplified with the use of Laravel core functions/features.
    - I will use [route model binding](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing#route-model-binding) to avoid explicitly using the `Model::find()` method. Laravel will take care of it in the route level.
    - I will move the data validations from the `BookingRepository.php` specifically in the functions that involve storing/updating/deleting of data to a separate [FormRequest](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/validation#form-request-validation) class.
    - For responses, instead of structuring the data within the repository's functions, I will move them to a separate class by using [API Resource Responses](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-resources#resource-responses). This way, we can reuse the Resource class if in case we need to display the same structure someplace else.
    - In functions that will return a list of records (e.g. `getUsersJobs`), to avoid compromising the server's memory (especially if loading thousands/millions of records) I will [chunk](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#chunking-results) the results in order to process large number of models efficiently.
    - For push notifications, I see that it's using OneSignal. There is already a [OneSignal notification channel](https://laravel-notification-channels.com/onesignal/) package that can be used for Laravel's built-in [Notification](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/notifications#introduction) feature. So I would use this instead of setting up from scratch (e.g. initializing OneSignal API keys and doing the CURL request from within the `sendPushNotificationToSpecificUsers`).
    - I will use [model/eloquent events](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#events) for parts wherein a model needs to be updated if another model gets updated. Example is in the `updateJob` function. If a status is changed and notification needs to be sent out, we can move the sending of notification part to a [Model Observer](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#observers) class.
    - I will update all status/error messages so that it can utilize [Laravel's Localization feature](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/localization).

With the above updates, I believe we can really slim down the Repository class and that way we have separation of concerns in our source code.
